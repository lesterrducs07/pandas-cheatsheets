PANDAS is a Python library used for working with data sets. it has functions for analyzing, cleaning, exploring, and manipulating data. pandas allows us to 
  analyze big data and make conclusions based on statistical theories. it can clean messy data sets, and make them readable and relevant.
  Relevant data is very important in data science.

*pip install pandas - to install in the terminal
import pandas as pd - to use pandas library in your IDE

WHAT IS SERIES is like a column in a table. It is a one-dimensional array holding data of any type.
pd.Series(varname, index="")
pd.Series(varname[0])
you can also use a key/value object, like a dictionary, when creating a Series. the key of dictionaries become the column labels
pd.Series(varname, index '["label1", "label2"]

INDEX is added in the function to make the row name change
index=""
COLUMNS is added in the function to make the column name change
column=""

DATAFRAMES datasets in Pandas are usually multi-dimensional tables, called DataFrames. if Series is like a column or row, 
a DataFrame is the whole table(column and row)
pd.DataFrame(varname)

LOC attribute to return one or more specified row(s)
varname.loc[0]
varname.loc[[0,1]]

IMPORTING A FILE IN PANDAS
pd.read_csv('path_to_directory_filename.csv')
pd.read_excel('path_to_directory_filename.xlsx') - you can load other type (sas, clipboard, html etc.)
pd.read_html('link_of_the_html_or_website', mathch="")
pd.read_json('jsonfile.json) -JSON objects have the same format as Python dictionaries.

TO STRING you can use it to prin all the value in the DataFrame
to_string()

pd.options.display.max_rows - to check the max returned rows
pd.options.display.max_rows = 9999

HEAD method returns the headers and a specified number of rows, starting from the top
head(10) - it will print the first 10 rows of the DataFrame

TAIL method returns the headers and a specified number of rows, starting from the bottom
tail() - return the last 5 rows

INFO gives you more information about the data set
info()

DATA CLEANING fixing and removing bad data in the dataset(empty cells, data in wrong format, wrong data, duplicates,)

DROPNA it will remove all rows in the DataFrame that contains NULL values
dropna() method returns a new DataFrame, and will not change the original
dropna(inplace= True) this method change the original DataFrame

FILLNA will insert value in the empty cell instead of deleting. it will replace all the empty cells VALUE
fillna(value, in place = True)

FILLNA SPECIFIED COLUMN, indicate column_name name to fill the VALUE to replace
varname["column_name"].fillna(value, inplace = True) 

MEAN to calculate the average value(sum of all value divided by number of values)
mean()

MEDIAN the value in the middle, after you have sorted all values ascending
median()

MODE the value that appears the most in the table
mode()
